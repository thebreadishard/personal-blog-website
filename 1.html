<p><div>An evening on earth begins.</div>
<div class="indent">I am sitting in a white armchair in my apartment. A sleeping armchair that will belong to my
daughter's once the apartment is sufficiently furnished. Next to me is a small
round table with a coaster on it, for the mug of tea in my hands. The working day
is over and I have no obligations.</div>
<div class="indent">Almost fifty years old I am and I pause to reflect on my life. Becoming a father has
succeeded, but other attempts to give my life meaning have not.
As a teenager, I had decided that trying to answer the question
why the universe exists was a meaningful fulfillment of my life, but that
attempt I gave up at the end of my studies. I had not mastered the language of
mathematics enough to be able to make sense of the Big Bang, the birth of the universe.
fathom. As a substitute goal, I wanted to make someone happy, to have a
lifelong relationship with someone, and I married. That plan also ended in
a fiasco. And what a failure it was. After that second disappointment, the enthusiasm
about life goals was over for a while.</div>
<div class="indent">Sitting in my armchair, I contemplate what went wrong. In my first
year of studying astronomy I enrolled in philosophy as a second
study, so that besides solving math sums I would have something to read.
had something to read. The following year I added a third study: law. With my
attention spread over so many different subjects, it was no wonder
that I did not sufficiently master the mathematics of the Big Bang. And as for my
relationship, I apparently wanted it so badly that I didn't pick up on signals that something was wrong.
something was going on. I didn't notice that my wife
longed for a life with a woman.</div>
<div class="indent">I rise from the chair and walk to the window at the front of the
apartment. The night sky over Lijnbaansgracht is starless, like a
urban night sky usually is. That's okay; I don't need a clear sky
to imagine the cosmos. The stars, the planets, the asteroids, they are
located in my imagination. Looking at the cosmos in my mind, I ask myself for the
first time in my life the following question: if you were to die tonight, say in ten
minutes, and in the little time you have left you would have to give your answer to
the question of why the universe exists, what would that answer be? Regardless of the
opinion of any scientist, prophet or believer? Simply: your
answer, on your deathbed.</div>
<div class="indent">Intuitively, I know that in order to give that answer, I have to cut a knot
about the amount of life in the universe. Life as in: living
matter. As in: living things. That life is important in both faith and
science. The Christian faith is largely about the protection
of and reverence for life. In science, two of the most important
open questions are how life originated on Earth and whether there is life on other planets.
The latter question is important not only in academia. According to a
survey of young people in Australia, which I happened to hear about
because Andrew Dunkley, the host of the podcast Space nuts
talked about in the intro to an episode, the question of whether there is life on other planets is
is, in fact, the most important unanswered question for young people in that country.
In recent years, astronomers using telescopes such as
Kepler and Tess have discovered that every star has its own planets, and since then
more and more people think there is life on other planets. But not
everyone thinks so. In the episode Where Are They, All Those Aliens? from the
podcast Closer to Truth, inventor and author Raymond Kurzweil says we are
&#39;probably are alone&#39;in the universe, evolutionary biologist Francisco Ayala claims that there may be other intelligent life, but not in the part of the universe observable to us
observable part of the universe, and astronomer Frank Drake finds it ridiculous
to think we are alone: &#39;There is nothing special about our solar system. What
has happened here has happened in lots of other places.&#39;</div>
<div class="indent">I leave my spot by the window and start pacing around the room.</div>
<div class="indent">I have to follow my own reasoning. Which one should it be? From studying
astronomy I know that since the beginning of time matter has been homogeneously distributed throughout
space. That all matter everywhere in the universe has changed in the same way
changed: into the same atoms and molecules, the same type of stars and planets.
Everywhere too are organic molecules, the precursors of life. They
have been found not only in interstellar gas nebulae, but also in a
protoplanetary disk four hundred light years away from us. That the
precursors of enzymes and proteins are widespread in the cosmos increases the
chance that life is, too.</div></p>
